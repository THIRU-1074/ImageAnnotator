# Core Functionalities of an Image Annotator

1. **Image Upload/Import**  
   - Upload images from local storage or import via URL.

2. **Drawing Annotations**  
   - Draw bounding boxes (rectangles) to mark regions.  
   - Draw other shapes (polygons, circles, lines, points) â€” depending on complexity.

3. **Select, Move, Resize, Delete Annotations**  
   - Select existing annotations.  
   - Drag/move or resize the drawn shapes.  
   - Delete unwanted annotations.

4. **Labeling/Tagging**  
   - Assign labels or categories to each annotation.  
   - Support for multiple classes/tags.

5. **Annotation List/Panel**  
   - View a list of all annotations with labels and coordinates.  
   - Click to highlight or jump to the annotation on the image.

6. **Zoom & Pan Image**  
   - Zoom in/out to annotate fine details.  
   - Pan the image when zoomed.

7. **Undo/Redo**  
   - Undo or redo annotation actions.

8. **Save & Export Annotations**  
   - Save annotations in local storage or backend.  
   - Export annotations to common formats like JSON, XML (Pascal VOC), CSV, COCO, YOLO format, etc.

9. **Multi-Image Support**  
   - Annotate multiple images in sequence.  
   - Switch between images easily.

10. **Keyboard Shortcuts**  
    - Support keyboard shortcuts for efficiency (e.g., delete, undo).

11. **Annotation Color Customization**  
    - Change colors of bounding boxes for better visibility or category coding.

12. **Collaborative Annotation (Advanced)**  
    - Support multiple users annotating simultaneously or reviewing annotations.

13. **Annotation Validation**  
    - Review and validate annotations before export.

14. **Performance Optimization**  
    - Handle large images and many annotations efficiently.

## Optional/Advanced Features

- Video annotation (frame by frame).  
- Integration with ML models for auto-labeling.  
- Annotation history and versioning.  
- Commenting on annotations.  
- Support for keypoints or landmarks.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
